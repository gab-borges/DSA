# DSA

Implementations related to Data Structures and Algorithms.

Made using the C and C++ programming languages.


## Features
- Sorting Algorithms, its variations and pre-made tests.
- Basic Data Structures, such as linked lists.
- Graph implementations

## Ideas
- Still need to implement Quicksort and Mergesort.
- Stacks, queues, hash tables and dynamic arrays yet to be made as well.
- Graph algorithms, such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall.
